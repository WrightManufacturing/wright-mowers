# Safety Precautions

## Important

This machine is capable of amputating hands and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.

- This machine is constructed only for off-road use mowing grass on lawns without obstacles such as stones, tree stumps, and steep inclines.
- The machine can also be used for other tasks when equipped with approved attachments, for example the Grass Gobbler and Velke. Some accessories may void your warranty.
- Lawn machines and all power equipment can be dangerous if used improperly or by untrained operators.
- The owner/user can prevent and is responsible for accidents, injuries occurring to people, or damage to property.
- Only operate the machine in daylight or good artificial light. Failure to clearly see the ground while operating may result in sudden impact, loss of control, or thrown objects.
- Only operate the engine in well ventilated areas. Exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide, a deadly poison.
- Lightning can cause severe injury or death. If lightning is seen, or thunder is heard in the area, do not operate the machine.
- Do not operate the machine while tired, ill, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
- This machine is designed for use by physically fit, experienced, and professional commercial operators which must be no less than 120 pounds and no more than 325 pounds.
- Do not wear radio or music headphones or use a digital device. Safe service and operation require your full attention.
- Always follow OSHA approved operation.
- When machine is left unattended, stored, or parked, lower the cutter deck until it rests on a positive mechanical stop.
- Do not carry passengers and keep bystanders away.
- Do not carry equipment on the machine.
- When loading or unloading use only a full-width ramp which is wider than the machine, provides good traction, and is not positioned with a steep angle. Use caution when loading or unloading.
- When hauling, tie the machine down with appropriately rated straps or chains.
- Never leave or park the machine unattended on sloped ground or incline.
- Use only approved repair parts to maintain.
- Unauthorized modifications to the machine may impair its function and safety.

## Safety features

The machine is designed with your safety in mind. It has the following safety systems with which you should become familiar:

- The warning decals on the machine including the instrument panel and cutter deck.
- The brake must be engaged and the PTO/blade switch “off” prior to starting the engine.
- The OPC switch must be actuated in order to engage the blades.
- Disengaging the Operator Presence Control (OPC) switch while the blades are running will cause the engine and blades to stop in seconds.
- Spring loaded chute deflector helps reduce trajectory of thrown objects.
- Belt, pulley, fan, and heat covers on to reduce access to moving and hot parts.
- Anti-tip rollers provided at the rear of the machine reduce the risk of machine tipping.
- DO NOT disable any of the safety features.
- Unauthorized modifications to the design of the machine will absolve the manufacturer from liability for any resulting personal injury or property damage.


## Training

- Read the operators manual, warnings, labels, attachments manual, engine manual, and other training material carefully. If the operator or mechanic cannot read the language provided, it is the owner’s responsibility to explain this material to them.
- Become familiar with the safe operation of the equipment, operator controls, and safety signs.
- All operators and mechanics should be trained. The owner is responsible for training the users.
- Never let children or untrained people operate or service the equipment. Local regulations may restrict the age of the operator.
- The owner/user can prevent and is responsible for accidents or injuries occurring to himself or herself, other people, or damage to property.
- Only allow operators, who are responsible, trained, familiar with the instructions, and physically capable to operate the machine.

## Preparation

- Carefully inspect and walk the property where you plan to use the machine for hidden, hard-to-see objects or uneven ground that may be hidden in the grass. Uneven terrain could
3-3
overturn the machine, or cause the operator to lose balance or footing.
- Clear the work area of moveable objects, including but not limited to, rocks, glass, toys, wires, dog chains/cables, and golf balls that might be picked up by the machine and dangerously thrown.
- Remove or mark the location of all immovable objects or irregular areas and be sure not to hit them with any part of the machine. Obstacles including and not limited to holes, abrupt changes in ground contour, tree trunks, stumps or roots, pipes or posts, paving edges, and rock outcroppings can abruptly turn or stop the machine. This could throw you off the machine or possibly over the handle bars causing serious injury or death.
- Check carefully for overhead obstacles (i.e. branches, clothes lines, doorways, electrical wire, decks, building overhangs, etc.) before operating and do not operate near them.
- Wear appropriate clothing and personal protective equipment; including safety glasses, long pants, substantial slip-resistant footwear, gloves, and hearing protection. Tie back long hair.
- Do not wear jewelry, sneakers, sandals, shorts, baggy clothing, or any clothing or accessories with loose loops or lanyards.
- Keep the area of operation clear of all bystanders, particularly small children. Stop the machine and attachment(s) if anyone enters the area.
- Check that the operator's presence controls, safety switches, interlocks, hardware, and shields are attached and functioning properly. Do not operate the machine unless they are functioning properly. Repair or replace damaged, badly worn, or missing parts
- Do not operate machine without the entire grass catcher, discharge chute, or other safety devices in place and functioning properly. Check frequently for signs of wear or deterioration and replace as needed.
- Ensure that all drives are in neutral and that the parking brake is engaged before starting engine. Start the electric start engines only from the operator’s position.
- Before using, always visually inspect to see that the blades, blade bolts and the mower assembly are not worn or damaged. Never straighten or weld blades.


## Operating
- Keep a firm hold of the stationary handle at all times. Keep both feet on the platform at all times.
- To prevent serious injury never place your foot or feet on the ground near the back edge of the machine while backing up.
- Do not suddenly push controls in forward direction while machine is in a rearward motion. Operate the controls smoothly.
- Do not mow in reverse unless absolutely necessary. Always look down and behind before and while backing to ensure a clear path. Use extra caution when operating in reverse.
- Do not operate the machine faster than conditions allow. For example, hills, wet or bumpy ground, dim light or high grass are all conditions requiring slower speeds. Never operate the machine at the highest speed unless you are on level, wide, open areas of clearly visible ground or transporting on paved areas. Speeding with any machine is dangerous, and so is traveling faster than conditions should permit on this machine. Sudden stops from excessive speed or falling off the machine may cause serious injury or death.
- Know the controls and how to stop quickly.
- During zero-radius turns (when one machine wheel rotates backwards while the other rotates forward) drive extra slowly to reduce the possibility of losing traction, losing control, or losing your balance. This will help prevent you from being thrown off the machine.
- Use care when approaching blind corners, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may obscure vision.
- Slow down and use caution when making turns and crossing roads and sidewalks. Stop the blades if you are not mowing. Watch for traffic when operating near or crossing roadways.
- Turn off blades and wait for them to stop before crossing roadways, gravel areas, and climbing or dismounting curbs.
- Do not raise the mower deck with the blades running.
- Do not direct discharge material toward anyone. Avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction. Material may ricochet back toward the operator.
- If the machine discharge clogs, turn off the blade clutch switch, apply the parking brake, stop the engine and remove the key before removing obstruction(s).
3-4
- Do not leave the machine running unattended. Always park on level ground, disengage the attachment, set parking brake, and stop engine.
- Stop on level ground, disengage drives, engage the parking brake, and shut off the engine before leaving the operator's position for any reason including emptying the catchers, unclogging the chute, and servicing the blades or cutter deck.
- Stop equipment and inspect the blades after striking objects or if an abnormal vibration occurs. Make the necessary repairs before resuming operations.
- Keep hands, feet and clothing away from rotating parts, especially the rear wheels, blades, engine flywheel, fans, belts and pulleys.
- Do not touch parts that may be hot from operation. Allow the machine to cool before attempting to maintain, adjust, service, unjamb, or service the machine.
- Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the machine. Keep clear of the discharge opening at all times.


## Slope Specific
- Before operating on slopes, walk the area and evaluate the surface for traction and smoothness. Slopes with drop offs, water, or compromised traction should be maintained through other maintenance techniques.
- Slow down and use extra care on hillsides. Be sure to travel in the recommended direction on hillsides. Turf conditions can affect the stability of the machine.
- Do not operate near drop-offs, ditches, embankments, or water. The machine could suddenly roll over if a wheel goes over the edge or the edge caves in. The machine could suddenly slide if traction is compromised. Leave a safety area between the machine and any hazard.
- Slow down and use caution when making turns and when changing directions on slopes.
- Slopes are a major factor related to accidents. Operation on all slopes requires extra caution.
- Establish your own special operating procedures and rules for operating on slopes. These procedures must include a survey of all mowing sites to determine which slopes are acceptable. Always use caution, and good judgement when performing this survey.
- Note that high traction conditions present a greater rollover hazard while lower traction conditions present a greater loss of control hazard. Ground and turf conditions vary
depending on the weather and must be taken into consideration at all times.
- Some liquid landscape chemicals contain surfactants which may by very slippery and severely compromise safe operation.
- Do not operate on steep slopes.
- Do not operate the machine on slopes when the grass is wet.
- Do not operate machine under any condition where traction, steering, or stability is in question. Tires could slide even if the wheels are stopped.
- Always keep the machine in gear when going down slopes. Do not coast downhill.
- Avoid starting and stopping on slopes. Avoid making sudden changes in speed or direction. Make turns slowly and gradually.
- Use extra care while operating machine with a grass catcher or other attachment(s). They can affect the stability of the machine.
- There is a danger of suddenly sliding sideways or down the hill. When operating on a slope, travel across the grade whenever possible, not in an up or down pattern.
- Reduce speed and exercise extreme caution on slopes and in sharp turns to prevent tipping or loss of control. Be especially cautious when changing direction on slopes.
- Do not operate tires that are worn beyond 3/32” of tread. Do not use unapproved treads or tire pressures. Unapproved treads or excessive pressures can compromise your traction.



## Children Specific
- Death or serious injury can occur when young children associate having fun with lawn mowing equipment.
- Children who have been entertained with power equipment in the past may be attracted to the machine while operating. Children do not understand the hazards of rotating blades and moving equipment. Never use the machine as a recreational vehicle or to entertain children.
- Never allow children or untrained operators to operate the machine. Instruct all operators to not give children rides.
- Tragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the machine and the mowing activity.
- Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.
- Keep children out of the operating area and under the watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.
3-5
- Do not carry children, even with the blade(s) shut off. Children could fall off and be seriously injured or interfere with safe machine operation. Children who have been given rides in the past could suddenly appear in the mowing area for another ride and be run over or backed over by the machine.
- Do not allow children to play on or around machine when not in use and never leave the key in the ignition switch. Children may be injured by hot components and are prone to attempt operating all functions of the equipment which may result in becoming pinched, crushed, or unintended operation.
Fire and Fuel Specific
- Besides routine maintenance, one of the best ways to reduce the risk of fire is to regularly check and remove debris and combustible residue from the machine.
- Use extra care when handling fuels. They are flammable and vapors are explosive.
- Use only an approved container.
- Do not remove the fuel cap or add fuel with the engine running. Allow the engine to cool before refueling.
- Keep the machine and engine free of grass, leaves, excessive grease, oil, or other debris at all times to reduce the risk of fire.
- Do not use the machine to push combustible materials, such as leaves, branches, or tall grass.
- Never smoke when handling fuel, and stay away from open flame or where fuel fumes may be ignited by spark.
- Never start the engine in an enclosed space with the presence of fuel vapor. Starting the engine may ignite fuel vapors.
- Do not smoke near the machine when the engine is running.
- Do not refuel indoors or in enclosed spaces.
- Never overfill the fuel tank.
- Remove machine from truck or trailer before fueling.
- Do not store the machine or fuel container, or refuel, where there is an open flame, spark, or pilot light such as on a water heater or other appliance.
- If fuel is spilled, do not attempt to start the engine and avoid creating any source of ignition until fuel vapors have dissipated.
- Allow machine to cool before storing or covering. Machine fires and structural fires can occur if a machine is stored before allowing it to cool.
- Always shut off fuel when storing or transporting.
- Check fuel lines, tank, cap and fittings frequently for cracks or leaks. Replace immediately if necessary.
